# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation Report

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics in the vue-quilly demo project following Vercel's official documentation for Vue applications.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files
1. **demo/package.json**
   - Added `vue-router` dependency (^4.6.4)
   - Reason: Required for route support in @vercel/analytics/vue package. The Analytics component automatically integrates with vue-router when available, providing enhanced tracking of page navigation events.

### Updated Lock File
- **demo/pnpm-lock.yaml** - Updated to reflect the new vue-router dependency and its transitive dependencies

## Implementation Details

### Current State (Already Implemented)
The following was already correctly implemented in the project:
- `@vercel/analytics` package was already present in package.json (version ^1.6.1)
- The `Analytics` component was already imported from '@vercel/analytics/vue' in src/App.vue
- The `<Analytics />` component was already placed in the template section of App.vue

### What Was Added
- Added `vue-router` as a dependency to support automatic route tracking
- This enables the Analytics component to track page navigation in addition to standard web vitals and page views

## Implementation Approach
Following the Vercel Web Analytics documentation for Vue applications:
- Import: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/vue'`
- Usage: Include `<Analytics />` component in the template
- Route Support: Automatic when vue-router is available in the project

## Testing & Verification
✅ Built successfully with `npm run build`
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ All dependencies resolved correctly
✅ Build output includes all required assets (667.80 kB JS, 68.72 kB CSS)

## Notes
- The project uses pnpm as the package manager
- No additional configuration is required; the Analytics component works out of the box
- The build warning about chunk sizes is pre-existing and unrelated to this change
- Route tracking is automatically enabled because vue-router is now installed

## Next Steps (For Deployment)
When deploying to Vercel:
1. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Analytics tab)
2. Deploy the application
3. The `/_vercel/insights/*` routes will be automatically added after deployment
4. Analytics data will appear in the dashboard after initial visitors access the site
